As a user,
            I need to be able to search for a certain volcano.
                -needed when expanding the map for other events?
            I need to see multiple layer images for a volcano.
            I need to view a brief summary of a volcano when I find its location.
                -Info Card popup 
            I want to be able to mouse navigate on the map.
                -done with Leaflet
            I want to see a history of the volcano when I have the info card open.
